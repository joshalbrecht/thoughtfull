# Thoughtfull

Thoughtfull is an in-progress tool for aggregating Slack threads, personal notes, and other reference material in a single searchable database.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to make it easy to collect snippets of information from multiple sources and retrieve them quickly. It is still in the early stages, so expect the details to change as the design evolves.

## Features

- Import posts and conversations from Slack threads
- Store personal notes and other text documents
- Unified search across all stored material

## Getting Started

At the moment the project does not yet provide a packaged release. To experiment with it you will need to clone the repository and build from source once code is available:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourname/thoughtfull.git
cd thoughtfull
```

Further instructions will be added here as the implementation progresses.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with improvements and bug fixes.

## License

This project will eventually be released under an open source license. The specific license will be added once the code base matures.
